Apologies for the lack of updates. It really does feel like only a couple months have passed since I last made a promise to myself to keep writing new blog posts...

2022 was **the most chaotic year in my life.** I've achieved a lot, earned a lot, but at the same time lost a lot, and yet again realized how little I've come compared to the far long road ahead. Let's take a step back and I'll give you a quick review of what I've been busy doing so far:

# Recap

A lot of things have happened in terms of achievements and change of tides, but the most significant of it all, I've managed to get a full-time job as a software engineer. Let's talk about it.

## Trying for a Software Engineer

In search for a way to finish my mandatory military service as a male korean citizen, I found out that by applying and acquiring a job for certain government-approved tech companies there was a way to both finish my alternative military service & get some working experience as a software engineer. Due to personal problems & the intensity of COVID-19 not seeming to settle down any time soon, I decided that it would be best to take a break from university and finish my military service just now.

So I went searching for numerous positions and companies, trying to figure out what would best suit me, and what I was ready for. It didn't take long to realize that I was not ready for a full time software engineer job whatsoever, the only thing I really knew how to do was solve mediocre DS&A problems. Sure I had done a little bit of frontend web development as a hobby for a few months, but let's face it, if that was enough for a proper job why would everyone else be struggling to get one as well. I needed something unique, something that would prove myself worthy, and a lot of confidence to get me through numerous job interviews.

And so it was on. After countless trial and error I managed to come up with a somewhat decent resume for my current status, applied to a lot of different positions scattered around in different fields, and spent a month or two waiting in fear. I was turtled up in a shell of self denial & insecurity, and the waves of rejection mails I received through my email inbox further strengthened my negative state as time went by. I started doubting myself, started to regret my past 2 years that I had spent in university, started to blame my past self for being so unprepared. Looking back, honestly it wasn't that bad, and I feel like I was a bit too harsh on myself, neglecting my strengths and only focusing on my weaknesses.

Thankfully one of the companies that I've applied for took focus on my said strengths and gave me an opportunity for a backend developer interview. Because I was absolutely not prepared for a backend job whatsoever, It came as a huge shock to me since I've already been rejected for the dozens of web frontend positions that I had applied for. Regardless it seemed like a great opportunity, so I took the interview, and thankfully passed to receive two different options for different teams. Little did I know that the choice here would make an absolutely huge difference after a few months..

## Becoming a Software Engineer

I think it may be worth to point out the little details of how I adapted to such new environments before lining out the big picture.

Introducing myself & getting used to my new colleagues turned out to be a much more difficult task than I had originally anticipated. It was honestly my first time facing myself in an environment where every other working individual was greater than me in every way, including aspects such as working efficiency and technical knowledge. I was stunned at my first view of a proper codebase that had been maintained for multiple years by many different individuals, stunned at the new microservices architecture that I had never before seen in action, and absolutely overloaded by the different technologies that were being used in their services. Different databases for different storage & query purposes, different external services used for marketing schemes, different server frameworks used for different microservices, and to top it all off, the complete separation of concerns when it came to the role of frontend & backend & devops engineers. I was not ready. I was shocked.

Thankfully as time went by I slowly began to learn and adapt to the new given environment, slowly began to learn the new server frameworks, slowly began to learn the server architecture, and slowly began to communicate properly with my new colleagues. In hindsight it was very selfish of me to act in such a defensive way when others were trying to help me, after all they all knew it was my first time working a full time software engineer job as well.

Hindsight is 20/20, but I should definitely keep it in mind that when it feels too overwhelming, then it is expected to be overwhelming in such situations and therefore it is ok to be overwhelmed with it. Taking it in at my own pace is important, and what matters is **how** you will overcome such challenging problems.

## Working as a Software Engineer

Now, working as a software engineer definitely was a different experience from studying & working on amateur projects by myself. With a coordinated team & skilled colleagues to help guide me around the various tasks I was given, I could get a better grasp of how people accomplish certain tasks rather than my own inefficient ways. It felt like I've learned a lot more in this single year than I had in the past few years. But the biggest accomplishment for me was that I found some confidence to challenge myself encountering new tasks, new technologies, and new people. Sure, it is still not easy when you're trying to learn something absolutely new from scratch, but the critical change in my mindset was that I stopped asking myself "Can I do this?". Rather, it's now a matter of "How long will it take for me to do this?".

## Widening my field of view

Another huge benefit of working professionally in a team/company instead of studying by myself was that it gave me a lot of opportunities to widen my field of view over various subjects. I slowly got to broaden my network of acquaintances, my knowledge over other domains that I wasn't actively working on, et cetera. At the same time it made me realize how little I've achieved so far compared to the long road ahead, therefore keeping me humble even after the little accomplishments that I'd been making throughout the year. Not losing confidence in yourself is of course very important for continuous self improvement, but knowing your place and staying humble is also one of the key aspects of not staying around the infamous _dunning kruger peak of mount stupid_.

## Searching for new goals

A huge key factor that is keeping me from feeling fully satisfied with my current position is that _I still don't know what goals I should be yearning for_. Sure, I'm now actively earning decent income from my job + slowly becoming more skilled and experienced in the vast field of software engineering(particularly, web server development is what I'm doing at work), but I'm not certain if this is what I would want myself to be doing for the rest of my life as a professional job that would define my career & identity. One of the most important aspects when it comes a task that I want to indulge myself in is:

> Would I feel proud of myself after accomplishing this task?

And do I feel proud of myself after what I'm doing right now? Well, building web servers for enterprise grade applications and keeping the entire service ecosystem healthy is not an easy task by any means, and it does give you a sense of accomplishment as you look at the services you built by your own hands provide value to the users who utilize it. It's definitely not bad, but... that's about it. It's not bad, and to me, it shouldn't be at the level of "not bad" if I want to be keep pushing myself further down this road. There could be a handful of reasons as to why my feeling of accomplishment is stuck at this somewhat neutral state, but it does make me a bit uncomfortable as I don't feel confident that what I'm actively pouring my time on will definitely make up for the cost further down the line.

As to how I would solve this problem right now, I think the answer lies in finding something unique. It could lie in the very methodology of how I work right now, or the entire subject of what I'm working on, or perhaps it may just be a matter of how I'm defining/projecting myself as a member of society. So in the new year I'm going to actively try out spending time on some new projects/activities that I've feared doing so far. New updates on that would hopefully come soon in the form of another blog post...(or making that ArtStation link finally mean something by putting in some work)

## Afterword

Of course, there was a lot more that happened this year than what meets the eye in this blog article. Various things have been excluded due to it being too personal, or being potentially confidential knowledge that I probably shouldn't be talking about on a public blog. I personally love to talk about such sensitive topics as long as they bring something of value to the table, so I probably will leave further explanations as time goes on. But for now, if you'd like to hear the full story, or rather you would also want to share your experiences in comparison, feel free to contact me during this January. I absolutely don't care who you are or where you're coming from, I'd just love to hear it.

That's all.
