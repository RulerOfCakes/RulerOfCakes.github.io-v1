It had been a while since I had done any projects related to game development, so I decided to join the fun in the second [Ludum Dare][LudumDare] event of this year!

The last game project that I had somewhat attempted to properly work on was a private test project with [Unreal Engine][ue4], which was technically my second experience with it. It probably wasn't enough to call myself experienced or comfortable with unreal, but with the relatively recent release of the early access of [Unreal 5][ue5], I decided that it was worth giving a try on a new project.

But starting from scratch with no particular goal in mind sounds boring and demotivating, so why not give myself a little bit of a challenge to heat things up?
I had already participated in the previous Ludum Dare 48 event, which was an absolute disaster due to it being my first time using Unreal(Initially I wanted to use Unity, but that's a whole other story) and bad teamwork... But this time things were different. I had my trustworthy teammates(Unbansheee(New Zealand), SilverBranch(Scotland)) to help me with graphics design and programming, I was more familiar with Unreal, and my C++ skills have also been improved after lots of participation in Competitive Programming. 

Since I was still less than a beginner in terms of graphics/design, I wanted to participate as a team, therefore we decided to join the event as a participant in the Jam section, which goes on for a 72 hour long period compared to the Compo section which is solo only and goes on for only 48 hours. Details of the event can be viewed [here.][LD49]

All Ludum Dare events begin with a voting period to select the theme for the event, and it was [no different this time.][LD49Vote] If my memory serves me right I was interested in Unstable, Decay and On/Off, mainly because personally it was easier to come up with different gameplay concepts with those themes.

The theme for this event turned out to be **unstable**, so we first began thinking of a decent idea. Due to different timezones it took us several hours to finally get things together and start working, but the final idea that we arrived at was the concept of a falling tower. We decided that for us to complete a game in the given 72 hour period it had to be a simple, hyper-casual style game since none of us were really experienced game developers, so naturally we arrived a gameplay concept of jumping and clmibing up through falling obstacles.

Admittedly it was a very redundant concept, so we needed something to make it feel unique compared to the many other hyper casual jumping/climbing type of games. Since enough time was wasted from the timezone issue, we decided to first work on the basic framework of the game before choosing unique gameplay mechanics.

## The process...
<details><summary><strong>Detailed process</strong></summary>

<p>
Although I previously stated that we were relatively unexperienced, we had worked on several demo projects with Unreal/Unity previously together, each project for about a month or two, so we were able to get our basic source control system up and running. Most people would use Git as their main source control software, and it does have most of the things you would need from a source control program while working as a team, but we've previously discovered that getting Git to work with Unreal Engine can be very cumbersome to set up properly. Plus the entirety of solving merge conflicts were an absolute nightmare when we're low on time, so as an alternative solution to Git we found out that [Perforce][Perforce] gives us what we needed. It wasn't exactly easier than Git to set it all up, but it made less errors and problems than Git did while we were working on the same project together, plus the checkout system was very useful in preventing merge conflicts in a fast paced environment. Therefore we used a copy of a previous setup we had on Unbansheee's server, and the starting process was pretty smooth.
</p>

<p>
After we had our initial project setup w/ source control all linked together, Unbansheee and I began making the basic classes necessary for the game. My previous experience of Unreal was mostly based on Unreal Engine 4, so it was my first time using Unreal Engine 5. The core mechanics were still pretty much the same from UE4, with the main additions of *Lumen and Nanite*, so I didn't really have any problem getting used to it. 
</p>

<p>
Our workflow was relatively simple: we basically had a small list of things to implement/create/design that was easily modifiable, and whenever someone felt like they were able to do something we would just announce what we were working on - and get working on it right away. Blueprints made it easier for others to participate with coding, so it naturally served as a midpoint for designers and programmers, but I was unable to do anything related to graphics.(I was studying Blender, but I wasn't confident/skilled enough with it yet.) Thankfully(?) it was the same for the others that they couldn't do anything related to C++ programming, so naturally we had our roles separated. I was making all the base classes with C++ and implementing complex mechanics that require optimization in C++, and the others would create 3D models in Blender, and together work on the (derived)Blueprint versions of the base classes. 
</p>

<p>
We began with Unbansheee working on the player's input/gameplay mechanics, and me working on the aforementioned falling obstacles. Since we were going to slowly refine our ideas as we had the basics being implemented, I simply made a static mesh object with varying speed, and Unbansheee was able to quickly make a sample mesh model to test it.
</p>

<p>
Unbansheee had been working on the player mechanics earlier before I had joined in properly, so we already had the basic movement + jumping implemented. We decided to add a unique mechanic to the player so that they could latch onto falling objects upon collision, and perform some sort of a wall jump. However we came across an odd bug: after latching and jumping, the player would occasionally phase through obstacles for a brief moment after the jump. We did fix it shortly after, but upon facing the problem of angle calculation to prevent jumping straight into other obstacles we decided to take a different approach. <i>It's not a bug, it's a feature...</i>
</p>

<p>
So our final gameplay mechanics turned out to be that the player can perform double jumps, latching onto an object would refresh both double jumps, and phasing through an object is only possible when you're directly latched onto the object before the jump. Although it looked weird it definitely improved the flexibility/flow of the gameplay, so we let the weird visuals pass for now. After all it's a game jam, it was not meant to be perfect anyways...

# The Result

![Final preview](/assets/img/2021-10-28-LudumDare49/HPES.png)
*preview image on our entry page.*

- _The preview image honestly doesn't do justice, the game looks a lot different when you're actually playing!_

The game is an **endless platformer** where you aim to climb up as high as you can get, your score is based on how high you have managed to climb in a 'run'. The player can move from left to right, can perform double jumps, and latch onto falling objects that aren't red colored. Your double jump is refreshed upon latching/landing on objects, and you can directly jump/phase through the object that you've latched onto to help make the game feel easier to play. There are also random powerups that spawn and fall down with various effects, such as slowing obstacle falling speed or launching the player up.

Our final entry page can be viewed [here][LDEntry], which contains the download links to our game as well. We were mostly aiming for completion rather than meaningful competition, so we didn't spend enough time playtesting other entries to gain more traction. (In Ludum Dare the more you playtest and give feedback to other games, the more traction your own entry gets.) It is a finished game nontheless, and we even have a global scoreboard implemented that can be viewed in-game. *Some say that a secret awaits at the top...*

One of the most notable feedback we received was that there wasn't enough introduction/indication to the game's detailed mechanics(such as the fact that you can actually land onto some of the un-latchable objects to refresh your jumps), and that the player movement wasn't exactly comfortable to play with before you get used to it. We had accidentally overlooked how the game would feel like to a new player while being busy implementing other mechanics of the game, which is what I should definitely keep in mind when I'm working on my next projects.

Overall it was a great experience, afterall it was my first succesfully completed game jam event & team project. Keeping our workflow clean and parallel with others was key in this fast-paced environment, and exchanging feedback as a programmer with the designers opened up a lot of new perspectives for me too. I'd say it is very recommendable for other game developers/graphic designers if you're looking for some interesting team experience, and I think I might even aim for the Compo section in the next event if I succesfully learn Blender enough to be able to do so.
